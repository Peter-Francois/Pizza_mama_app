## üçï Pizza Mama App üçï

Welcome to Pizza Mama, the pizzeria app that lets you explore a delicious menu of pizzas! This app is designed to provide a seamless experience for customers, offering updated pizza information, including prices and ingredients, directly from our Django-based API.

## üõ† Key Features

- Real-Time Menu Updates: The app automatically fetches the latest pizza data from the Django API, ensuring the menu is always up to date.

- Detailed Pizza Information: View the list of available pizzas with their prices and full ingredient details.

- Easy Integration: Uses a REST API backend to keep the app's data in sync with changes made by the admin.

## How It Works

Backend: A web application built using Django serves as the backend, where the admin can:

- Add new pizzas.

- Modify existing recipes or prices.

- Remove pizzas from the menu.

API: The Django backend exposes a RESTful API that:

- Provides endpoints to retrieve pizza data.

- Supports real-time updates for the app.

- Frontend: The mobile or web app fetches data from the API to display the menu to users.
